{{site.project_title}} provides several sets of elements, which you can reuse simply by
including them in your project. If you don't want to write any code, keep reading!

## Installing elements {#install}

You can install elements one at a time, or install a whole collection of elements.

{{site.project_title}} contains two primary collections of elements:

-   <a href="/docs/elements/core-elements.html">{{site.project_title}} Core elements</a>. A set of utility
    elements including general-purpose UI elements (such as icons, layout elements, and toolbars),
    as well as  non-UI elements providing features like AJAX, signaling and storage.

-   [Paper elements](/docs/elements/paper-elements.html). A set of UI elements that implement the 
    [material design system](/docs/elements/material.html).


If you find an element you want while browsing the docs, simply click
the download button and choose your install method. See 
[Getting the Code](getting-the-code.html) for more information on the various methods.

Click a button below to install one of the element collections:

  <component-download-button org="Polymer" component="core-elements" label="GET THE {{site.project_title}} CORE ELEMENTS">
  </component-download-button>

  <component-download-button org="Polymer" component="paper-elements" label="GET THE PAPER ELEMENTS">
  </component-download-button>


**Note:** The PolymerLabs github repo contains a number of unsupported elements that are either 
experimental or deprecated. In particular, the `polymer-elements` and `polymer-ui-elements` 
collections represent earlier work superseded by the {{site.project_title}} Core elements and 
Paper elements.

## Using elements {#using}

To use elements, first load `platform.js`. Many browsers have yet to implement the various web components APIs. Until they do, `platform.js` provides [polyfill support](/docs/start/platform.html). **Be sure to include this file before any code that touches the DOM.**

Once you have some elements installed and you've loaded `platform.js`, using an element is simply a matter of loading the element file using an [HTML Import](/platform/html-imports.html).

An example `index.html` file:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <!-- 1. Load platform.js for polyfill support. -->
        <script src="bower_components/platform/platform.js"></script>

        <!-- 2. Use an HTML Import to bring in the element. -->
        <link rel="import"
              href="bower_components/core-ajax/core-ajax.html">
      </head>
      <body>
        <!-- 3. Declare the element. Configure using its attributes. -->
        <core-ajax url="http://example.com/json"
                   handleAs="json"></core-ajax>

        <script>
          // Wait for 'polymer-ready'. Ensures the element is upgraded.
          window.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function(e) {
            var ajax = document.querySelector('core-ajax');

            // Respond to events it fires.
            ajax.addEventListener('core-response', function(e) {
              console.log(this.response);
            });

            ajax.go(); // Call its API methods.
          });
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>

**Note:** You must run your app from a web server for the [HTML Imports](/platform/html-imports.html)
polyfill to work properly. This requirement goes away when the API is available natively.

###  Passing object and array values in attributes {#objectarray}

[HTML attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes) are string values, but sometimes you need to pass more complicated values into a custom element, such as objects or arrays. Ultimately, it's up to the element author to decide how to decode values passed in as attributes, but many {{site.project_title}} elements understand attribute values that are a JSON-serialized object or array. For example:

    <roster-list persons='[{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Bob"}]'></roster-list>

For {{site.project_title}} elements, you can find the expected type for each attribute listed in the [Elements reference](/docs/elements/). If you pass the wrong type, it may be decoded incorrectly.

When creating your own {{site.project_title}} elements, you can choose to expose properties as attributes, as described in [Published properties](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#published-properties).

## Next steps {#nextsteps}

Now that you've got the basic idea of using and installing elements, it's time to start
building something! In the next section we'll cover the features of {{site.project_title}} and how to create new `<polymer-element>`s. Continue on to:

<a href="/docs/start/creatingelements.html">
  <paper-button icon="arrow-forward" label="Creating elements" raisedButton></paper-button>
</a>

If you'd rather browse the existing elements, check out the 
<a href="/docs/elements/core-elements.html">{{site.project_title}} Core elements</a> 
and <a href="/docs/elements/paper-elements.html">Paper elements</a> catalogs.
