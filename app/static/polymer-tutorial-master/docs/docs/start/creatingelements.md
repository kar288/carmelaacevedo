{{site.project_title}} makes it simple to create web components, declaratively.
Custom elements are defined using our custom element,  `<polymer-element>`, and can leverage
{{site.project_title}}'s special features. These features reduce boilerplate
and make it even easier to build complex, web component-based applications:

- [Two-way data binding](/docs/polymer/databinding.html)
- [Declarative event handing](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#declarative-event-mapping)
- [Declarative inheritance](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#extending-other-elements)
- [Property observation](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#observeprops)
- Dynamic templates
- Touch/gesture support
- ...

## Setup {#basics}

### 1. Install {{site.project_title}} {#install}

Install the latest version of {{site.project_title}} as described in [Getting the Code](/docs/start/getting-the-code.html).

### 2. Build a {{site.project_title}} element {#createpolyel}

{{site.project_title}} provides extra goodies for creating declarative, souped-up custom elements. We call these "{{site.project_title}} elements". From the outside they look just like any other DOM element, but inside they're filled with handy features like two-way data binding and other bits of [{{site.project_title}} magic](/docs/polymer/polymer.html). These features make it easy to build complex components with much less code.

To create a new element:

1. Load [{{site.project_title}} core](/docs/polymer/polymer.html) (`polymer.html`).
2. Declare your custom element using `<polymer-element>`.

In the following example, we define a new element named `<my-element>`, save
it to a file `elements/my-element.html`, and use an HTML Import to load the `polymer.html` dependency.

**my-element.html**

    <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">

    <polymer-element name="my-element" noscript>
      <template>
        <span>Hello from <b>my-element</b>. This is my Shadow DOM.</span>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>

Two items to notice:

* The `name` attribute is required and **must** contain a "-". It specifies the name of the HTML tag you'll instantiate in markup (in this case `<my-element>`).

* The `noscript` attribute indicates that this is a simple element that doesn't include any script. An element declared with `noscript` is registered automatically.

#### Reusing other elements {#reuse}

By composing simple elements together we can build richer, more complex components. To reuse other elements in your `<polymer-element>`, install the element in your app:

    bower install Polymer/core-ajax

and include an import that loads the new dependency in `my-element.html`:

{%raw%}
    <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">
    <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/core-ajax/core-ajax.html">

    <polymer-element name="my-element" noscript>
      <template>
        <span>I'm <b>my-element</b>. This is my Shadow DOM.</span>
        <core-ajax url="http://example.com/json" auto response="{{resp}}"></core-ajax>
        <textarea value="{{resp}}"></textarea>
      </template>
    </polymer-element>
{%endraw%}

### 3. Create an app {#creatapp}

Lastly, create an `index.html` that imports your new element. Remember to include `platform.js`
to load polyfills for the native APIs.

Here's the full example:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <!-- 1. Load platform support before any code that touches the DOM. -->
        <script src="bower_components/platform/platform.js"></script>
        <!-- 2. Load the component using an HTML Import -->
        <link rel="import" href="elements/my-element.html">
      </head>
      <body>
        <!-- 3. Declare the element by its tag. -->
        <my-element></my-element>
      </body>
    </html>

**Note:** You must run your app from a web server for the [HTML Imports](/platform/html-imports.html)
polyfill to work properly. This requirement goes away when the API is available natively.
{: .alert .alert-info }

Your final directory structure should look something like this:

    yourapp/
      bower_components/
        platform/
        polymer/
      elements/
        my-element.html
      index.html

Now that you've got the basic setup, it's time to start using the features!

## Using {{site.project_title}}'s features {#features}

{{site.project_title}} provides a number of sugaring APIs for authoring
web components. Below are a few of the concepts. Consult the [API reference](/docs/polymer/polymer.html) for
detailed information on each of these features.

### Add properties and methods {#propertiesmethods}

When you're creating a new element, you'll often need to expose a [public API](/polymer/polymer.html#published-properties) so users can configure it. To define a public API, include a `<script>` tag that calls `{{site.project_title}}('your-tagname')`.  The `{{site.project_title}}(...)` constructor is a convenience wrapper for [`document.registerElement`](/platform/custom-elements.html#documentregister), but also endows the element with special features like data binding and event mapping. Its first argument is the name of the element you're creating. The second argument (optional) is an object that defines your element's prototype.

{% include samples/tk-element-proto.html %}

### Adding lifecycle methods

[Lifecycle callbacks](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#lifecyclemethods) are special methods you can define on your element which fire when the element goes through important transitions.

When a custom element has been registered it calls its `created()` callback (if one has been defined). When {{site.project_title}} finishes its initialization, the `ready()` method is called.
The `ready` callback is a great place to do constructor-like initialization work.

{% include samples/tk-element-created.html %}

Learn more about all of the [lifecycle callbacks](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#lifecyclemethods).

### Declarative data binding

Data binding is a great way to quickly propagate changes in your element and reduce boilerplate code. You can bind properties in your component using the "double-mustache" syntax (`{%raw%}{{}}{%endraw%}`). The `{%raw%}{{}}{%endraw%}` is replaced by the value of the property referenced between the brackets.

{% include samples/tk-element-databinding.html %}

Note: {{site.project_title}}'s data-binding is powered under the covers by a sub-library called [TemplateBinding](/docs/polymer/template.html), designed for other libraries to build on top of.
{: .alert .alert-info}

#### Binding to markup

You can use binding expressions in most HTML markup, except for tag names themselves. In the following example, we create a new property on our component named `color` whose value is bound to the value of the `color` style applied to the custom element. Bindings ensure that any time a property like `color` is changed, the new value will be propagated to all binding points.

{% include samples/tk-element-databinding-color.html %}

#### Binding between components and built-in elements {#bindingtobuiltin}

You can use bindings with built-in elements just like you would with Polymer elements. This is a great way to leverage existing APIs to build complex components. The following example demonstrates binding component properties to attributes of native input elements.

{% include samples/tk-binding-to-elements.html %}

**Note:** Giving `age` an initial value `25` gives {{site.project_title}}
a hint that this property is an integer.
{: .alert alert-info}

In this example, `nameChanged()` defines a property changed watcher. {{site.project_title}} will then call this method any time the `name` property is updated. Read more about [changed watchers](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#change-watchers).

### Publishing properties {#publishing}

Published properties can be used to define an element's "public API". {{site.project_title}}
establishes two-way data binding for published properties and provides access
to the property's value using `{%raw%}{{}}{%endraw%}`.

_Publish_ a property by listing it in the `attributes` attribute in your `<polymer-element>`. Properties declared this way are initially `null`. To provide a more appropriate default value, include the same property name directly in your prototype.

The following example defines two data-bound properties on the element, `owner` and `color`,
and gives them default values:

{% include samples/tk-element-property-public.html %}

In this example the user overrides the defaults for `owner` and `color`
by configuring the element with initial attribute values (e.g. `<color-picker owner="Scott" color="blue">`).

**Note**: When binding  a property that takes a type other than String, it's important to [hint a property's type](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#attrhinting). {{site.project_title}} relies on this information to correctly serialize and de-serialize values.
{: .alert .alert-success }

[Learn more about published properties](/docs/polymer/polymer.html#published-properties).

### Automatic node finding

The use of the `id` attribute has traditionally been discouraged as an anti-pattern because the document requires element IDs to be unique. Shadow DOM, on the other hand, is a self-contained document-like subtree; IDs in that subtree do not interact with IDs in other trees. This means the use of IDs in Shadow DOM is not only permissible, it's actually encouraged. Each {{site.project_title}} element generates a map of IDs to node references in the element's template. This map is accessible as `$` on the element and can be used to quickly select the node you wish to work with. 

{% include samples/tk-node-finding.html %}
