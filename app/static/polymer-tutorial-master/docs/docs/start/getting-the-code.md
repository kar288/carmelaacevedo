## Installing {{site.project_title}} {#installing-polymer}

If you want to learn {{site.project_title}}, the easiest way to get started is
 to download the starter project:

<p layout horizontal center-justified>
  <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-tutorial/archive/master.zip">
    <paper-button icon="file-download" id="download-button" raisedButton label="Download Starter Project" onclick="downloadStarter()"></paper-button>
  </a>
</p>

The starter project includes {{site.project_title}}, a set of elements, and a starter app.
Work through the tutorial for an introduction to {{site.project_title}} APIs and concepts, 
or work through the finished app on your own.

<a href="/docs/start/tutorial/intro.html">
  <paper-button icon="arrow-forward" label="START THE TUTORIAL" raisedButton></paper-button>
</a>

If you're ready to start your own project, you can pick and choose the 
components you want to install, or install a whole set of components, 
like the Paper element collection.

## Installing components {#installing-components}

{{site.project_title}} is very modular; you can install just the {{site.project_title}}
library and platform polyfills, a single element, or a whole collection of elements.

Throughout the site, you'll find component download buttons like this:

<component-download-button org="Polymer" component="paper-elements" label="GET THE PAPER ELEMENTS">
</component-download-button>

The component download button offers three ways to install a component or set of components:

*   Bower. **Recommended**. Bower manages dependencies, so installing a component
    also installs any missing dependencies. Bower also handles updating
    installed components. For more information, see [Installing with Bower](#using-bower).

*   ZIP file. Includes all dependencies, so you can unzip it and start using it 
    immediately. The ZIP file requires no extra tools, but doesn't provide a 
    built-in method for updating dependencies. For more information, see
    [Installing from ZIP files](#using-zip).

*   Github. When you clone a component from Github, you need to manage all of the dependencies
    yourself. If you'd like to hack on the project or submit a pull request, see 
    [setting up {{site.project_title}} with git](/resources/tooling-strategy.html#git).

Pick your method and follow the instructions in the download dialog.

### Installing with Bower {#using-bower}

The recommended way to install **{{site.project_title}} {{site.latest_version}}**
is through Bower. To install Bower, see the [Bower web site](http://bower.io/). 

Bower removes the hassle of dependency management when developing or consuming
elements. When you install a component, Bower makes sure any dependencies are
installed as well. 

#### Project setup

If you haven't created a `bower.json` file for your application, run this
command from the root of your project:

    bower init

This generates a basic `bower.json` file. Some of the questions, like 
"What kind of modules do you expose," can be ignored by pressing Enter.

The next step is to install one or more {{site.project_title}} packages:

    bower install --save Polymer/polymer

Bower adds a `bower_components/` folder in the root of your project and 
fills it with {{site.project_title}} and its dependencies.

**Tip:** `--save` adds the item as a dependency in *your* app's bower.json:
```
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "polymer": "Polymer/polymer#~{{site.latest_version}}",
  }
}
```
{: .alert .alert-success }

#### Selecting packages

Using the component download button, click the **Bower** tab 
and cut and paste the Bower install command.

You can also choose one of the commonly-used packages:

-   `Polymer/polymer`. Just the {{site.project_title}} library
    and platform polyfills. 

-   `Polymer/core-elements`. The 
    [{{site.project_title}} Core elements](/docs/elements/core-elements.html) 
    collection.

-   `Polymer/paper-elements`. The 
    [Paper elements](/docs/elements/paper-elements.html) collection.

For example, if you'd like to install {{site.project_title}}â€™s collections 
of pre-built elements, run the following commands from the terminal:

    bower install --save Polymer/core-elements
    bower install --save Polymer/paper-elements


#### Updating packages {#updatebower}

When a new version of {{site.project_title}} is available, run `bower update`
in your app directory to update your copy:

    bower update

This updates all packages in `bower_components/`.

### Installing from ZIP files {#using-zip}

When you download a component or component set as a ZIP file, you get all of 
the dependencies bundled into a single archive. It's a great way to get 
started because you don't need to install any additional tools.

Expand the ZIP file in your project directory to create a `components` folder.

![](/images/zip-file-contents.png)

If you download multiple component sets as ZIP files, you'll usually end up with 
multiple copies of some dependencies. You'll need to merge the contents of the 
ZIP files.

Unlike Bower, the ZIP file doesn't provide a built-in method 
for updating dependencies. You can manually update components with a new ZIP 
file. 

### Using git {#git}

Because there are a number of dependencies we suggest you install 
{{site.project_title}} with Bower instead of git. If you'd like to hack on 
the project or submit a pull request check out our guide on 
[setting up {{site.project_title}} with git](/resources/tooling-strategy.html#git).

## Next steps {#nextsteps}

Now that you've installed {{site.project_title}} it's time to learn the core 
concepts. In the next section we'll get you up and running on using elements 
in a project. Continue on to:
